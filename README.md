This repository is for the fourth-year project of Dotan Levy and Amit Toker, who are Electrical and Computer Engineering students at Ben-Gurion University.

The aim of this project is to develop a Physics-Informed Neural Network that can predict, with minimal error, the complex electrical field of a signal passing through a fiber optic medium.
This network is intended to potentially replace the older method of numerically solving the Non-Linear Schrödinger Equation—known as the Split Step Fourier Method (SSFM).
SSFM is computationally intensive and thus time-consuming and power-demanding.
We hope to address these issues with our project.

First run the "Data gen" code and after that run "main"
